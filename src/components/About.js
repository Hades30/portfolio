            Hailing from the charming city of Siliguri in West Bengal, India,
            nestled amidst the Himalayan foothills and surrounded by verdant tea
            gardens, I am passionate about building innovative solutions.

            When not coding away, you&apos;ll find me trekking and hiking, or strumming
            my guitar, ukulele, piano, and even dabbling in a bit of drumming.
          </p>
          <p>
            Feel free to reach out to me, as I relish exploring all things
            FrontEnd.
